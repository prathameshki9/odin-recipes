            <h1>Chili Garlic Paneer</h1>
            <p>
              While many of you may want to give homemade paneer a try, you
              might not want a pan of frying cheese splattering your stovetop,
              Whether it's the star, or just part of an ensemble cast, I love
              how it soaks in all the other flavors, while somehow still
              retaining its shape. No matter how you use it, I really do hope
              you give this a try soon. Enjoy!
            </p>

          <h2>Directions</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Heat milk in a large pot on between medium and medium-high heat to
              195 degrees F to 205 degrees F (90 to 9 degrees C) until milk is
              almost simmering. Reduce heat to low, and stir in yogurt and 3
              tablespoons lemon juice. Stir for about 30 seconds, and if milk
              isnâ€™t separating into curds and whey, stir in another 1 to 2
              tablespoons lemon juice.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once curds form, turn off heat, and pour in cold water to stop the
              cooking process and cool mixture. Pour curds into a cheesecloth or
              a cotton towel lined colander and drain out whey. Whey can be
              reserved for other uses.
            </li>
            <li>
              Let curds sit and drain for 5 to 10 minutes, before gathering up
              the cloth, and squeezing out excess liquid. Be careful to not burn
              yourself, as the liquid may still be very hot. Press curds between
              layers of cloth into a disc of about 2 inches high, being careful
              not to leave excess cloth bunched up on top, or underneath the
              cheese. Place something flat over the cheese, and place a heavy
              pan on top to weigh down. Leave paneer under the weight until very
              firm to the touch, 30 to 90 minutes. Wrap and refrigerate until
              well chilled before using.
            </li>
            <li>
              For the chili garlic marinade combine garlic, Scriracha, yogurt.
              lemon juice, garam masala, and kosher salt in a bowl; mix until
              well combined.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cut paneer into squares or rectangles about 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick,
              and add to the marinade, tossing well to coat thoroughly on both
              sides. Wrap and marinate paneer for at least 4 hours.
            </li>
            <li>
              Combine yogurt, cilantro, jalapeno, lime juice, and salt for the
              yogurt dipping sauce in a blender; blend until smooth.
            </li>
            <li>
              Melt butter in a non-stick pan over medium-high heat and pan-fry
              paneer until well browned, about 2 minutes per side. Serve
              immediately with dipping sauce.
            </li>
